- To predict the next digit in a sequence of odd numbers using a simple neural network, let's outline the approach and then proceed to implement it.
   - To predict the next digit in a sequence of odd numbers, we will:
      - Generate a dataset of sequences of odd numbers.
      - Prepare the data for training, including features and labels.
      - Define a simple neural network model.
      - Train the model on the prepared data.
      - Evaluate the model's performance.
